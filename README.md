### Level 1 – Crop identification

Hunger is a global problem. To build tools to tackle hunger, we must start by understanding a single crop at a single location. 
Rice is a staple food for four billion people, more than half of the world’s population. It is the livelihood for a fifth of the global population.
But both the amount of land available for rice and the yield growth rates are in decline.

THe goal in this challenge is to build models that can identify the areas where rice is cultivated. The results can then be extrapolated to other locations
and even other crops.
